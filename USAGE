# Usage

NOTE: You should have a correct /boot entry in /etc/fstab before starting.

1. Create the /boot/kernels directory which will hold your files

2. Create a directory for each kernel you want in this folder.

Example:

/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03
/boot/kernels/3.12.9-KS.01
/boot/kernels/3.13.3-KS.01

3. Place your 'vmlinuz-3.11.2-FN.03' and other kernel files into their
directories using just their name. Example:

/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/vmlinuz
/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/initrd

(optional)
/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/System.map
/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/config

4. Open /etc/bliss-boot/config.py and edit the 'bootloader' line to select your bootloader.

A) Set bootloader to your choice: grub2, extlinux, etc...

B) Select your 'default' kernel (should match the directory name /boot/kernels)

C) Change any other options that are applicable to you

D) Add your kernel to the 'kernels' list and its options. Example:

kernels = (
	("Gentoo", "3.11.2-FN.03", "root=tank/gentoo/root quiet"),
	("Debian", "3.12.9-KS.01", "root=/dev/sda4 options='ro' quiet"),
	("Arch", "3.13.3-KS.01", "root=/dev/mapper/vg-root quiet"),
)

5. Run 'bliss-boot' and it should automatically detect your kernels
and desired options and generate a configuration file for your desire kernel
in the directory you are currently in. Take this file and put it in the
appropriate location in /boot.

-----------------

Optional:

All bootloader installs assume/will do the following:

1. If the '-d' flag is not passed, it will use the /boot drive's entry in /etc/fstab
2. If installing extlinux and nothing is passed to the '-E' flag, then extlinux will
   be installed in /boot/extlinux.

To install the GRUB 2 bootloader:

bliss-boot -G

To install Extlinux:

bliss-boot -E

To specify which drive to install the bootloader, you can use the '-d' flag:

bliss-boot -d <drive> -G
bliss-boot -d <drive> -E

To specify the folder to install extlinux to:

bliss-boot -E (optional: target folder)
bliss-boot -E (optional: target folder) -d /dev/sda

If installing extlinux, the program will also detect if your drive is mbr or gpt and write the appropriate
firmware to the disk. If the drive is also GPT, it will toggle the legacy bios bootable flag.
