# Usage

NOTE: You should have a correct /boot entry in /etc/fstab before starting.

1. Create the /boot/kernels directory which will hold your files

2. Create a directory for each kernel you want in this folder.

Example:

/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03
/boot/kernels/3.12.9-KS.01
/boot/kernels/3.13.3-KS.01

3. Place your 'vmlinuz-3.11.2-FN.03' and other kernel files into their
directories using just their name. Example:

/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/vmlinuz
/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/initrd

(optional)
/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/System.map
/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/config

4. Open /etc/bliss-boot/conf.py and edit the 'bootloader' line to
select your bootloader.

A) Set bootloader to your choice: grub2, extlinux, etc...

B) Select your 'default' kernel (should match the directory name /boot/kernels)

C) Change any other options that are applicable to you

D) Add your kernel to the 'kernels' list and its options. Example:

kernels = (
	( "Gentoo", "3.11.2-FN.03", "root=tank/gentoo/root quiet"),
	( "Debian", "3.12.9-KS.01", "root=/dev/sda4 options='ro' quiet"),
	( "Arch", "3.13.3-KS.01", "root=/dev/mapper/vg-root quiet"),
)

5. Run 'bliss-boot' and it should automatically detect your kernels
and desired options and generate a configuration file for your desire kernel
in the directory you are currently in. Take this file and put it in the
appropriate location in /boot.

-----------------

Optional:

To install the GRUB 2 bootloader automatically to your disk (/boot drive in fstab),
you can use the following command:

bliss-boot -G

To install extlinux to your disk you can use the following command:

bliss-boot -E (optional: <path to folder>)

If you want to specifically tell bliss-boot where to install the bootloader, use the '-d' flag:

bliss-boot -d <drive>

If the argument are left blank, bliss-boot will automatically use the /boot entry in your /etc/fstab.

If installing extlinux, the program will also detect if your drive is mbr or gpt and write the appropriate
firmware to the disk. If the drive is also GPT, it will toggle the legacy bios bootable flag.
