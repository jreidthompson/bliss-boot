# Usage

NOTE: You should have a correct /boot entry in /etc/fstab before starting.

1. Create the /boot/kernels directory which will hold your files

2. Create a directory for each kernel you want in this folder.

Example:

/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03
/boot/kernels/3.12.9-KS.01
/boot/kernels/3.13.3-KS.01

3. Place your 'vmlinuz-3.11.2-FN.03' and other kernel files into their directories. Example:

/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/vmlinuz
/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/initrd

(optional)
/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/System.map
/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/config

4. Open /etc/bliss-boot/config.py and edit the 'bootloader' line to select your bootloader.

A) Set bootloader to your choice: grub2, extlinux, etc...

B) Add your kernel to the 'kernels' list and its options. Make the third parameter a 1 instead of a 0
to make it the default kernel in the bootloader. Example:

kernels = (
    ("Gentoo", "3.11.2-FN.03", 0, "vmlinuz", "initrd", "root=tank/gentoo/root quiet"),
    ("Debian", "3.12.9-KS.01", 0, "vmlinuz-3.12.9-KS.01", "initramfs.img", "root=/dev/sda4 options='ro' quiet"),
    ("Arch", "3.13.3-KS.01", 1, "bzImage", "initramfs-3.13.3-KS.01", "root=/dev/mapper/vg-root quiet"),
)

C) Change any other options that are applicable to you

5. Run 'bliss-boot' and it should automatically detect your kernels
and desired options and generate a configuration file for your desire kernel
in the directory you are currently in. Take this file and put it in the
appropriate location in /boot.

* Tip: You can pass the -o flag to change the output path. Assuming we have 'grub2' as the bootloader
       we want to generate a config file for, you could do:
       bliss-boot -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
