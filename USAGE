# Usage

NOTE: You should have a correct /boot entry in /etc/fstab before starting.

1. Create the /boot/kernels directory which will hold your files

2. Create a directory for each kernel you want in this folder.

Example:

/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03
/boot/kernels/3.12.9-KS.01
/boot/kernels/3.13.3-KS.01

3. Place your 'vmlinuz-3.11.2-FN.03' and other kernel files into their
directories using just their name. Example:

/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/vmlinuz
/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/initrd

(optional)
/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/System.map
/boot/kernels/3.11.2-FN.03/config

4. Open /etc/bliss-boot/conf.py and edit the 'bootloader' line to
select your bootloader.

A) Set bootloader to your choice: grub2, extlinux, lilo, etc...

B) Select your 'default' kernel (should match the directory name /boot/kernels)

C) Change any other options that are applicable to you

D) Add your kernel to the 'kernels' list and its options. Example:

kernels = {
	"3.11.2-FN.03" : "root=/dev/sda4 quiet",
	"3.12.9-KS.01" : "root=/dev/sda4 options='ro' quiet",
	"3.13.3-KS.01" : "root=/dev/mapper/vg-root quiet",
}

5. Run 'bliss-boot' and it should automatically detect your kernels
and desired options and generate a configuration file for your desire kernel
in the directory you are currently in. Take this file and put it in the
appropriate location in /boot.
