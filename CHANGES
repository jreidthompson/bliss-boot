2.1.0
------------
- Removed support for installing bootloaders. You should use the normal tools directly.
  This means that this application is solely purposed to be a frontend for easy bootloader
  configuration generation (Which was the original purpose of this app).
- Relicensed to the GPLv2 (Only GPLv2, Not GPLv2+)
- Other minor improvements

2.0.3
------------
- Relicensed to the Simplified BSD License

2.0.2
------------
- Relicensed back to MPL 2.0

2.0.1
------------
- Relicensed to the GPLv2 (Only GPLv2, Not GPLv2+)

2.0.0
------------
- The application has been refactored.
- Relicensed to the Apache License 2.0
- Supports generating the correct bootloader configuration when using UUID=/PARTUUID= for the /boot in /etc/fstab
- You are now able to set the kernel and initrd names for each entry
- Fixed a bug where if multiple entries had the same kernel version, the generator would label
  all of those entries with the same index.
- The default kernel is now defined within the kernel array and not a separate 'default' option
- Fixed a bug where specifying a non-absolute path to an output file would cause a FileNotFound exception.
- UUID=/PARTUUID= are also supported when trying to install the bootloader via the -d command.
  Example: bliss-boot -B -G -d UUID=4443433f-5f03-475f-974e-5345fd524c34
  The above would only install the grub 2 bootloader to the drive with that specified UUID.

1.1.0
------------
- Fixed a bug where the partition layout for the boot drive wasn't being parsed correctly.
- Fixed a bug where writing a config file via -o to a non-existent directory would cause an error.
- You are now able to just install the bootloader without having to generate a config file as well.
  (pass the --only-bootloader, or -B flag).

1.0.1
------------
- Fixed a bug where the default kernel numbers and labels weren't being written with the correct index

1.0.0
------------
- Relicensed back to MPL 2.0
- The entire program was rewritten to have a better OO structure and faster/less redundancy on various parts of the code.
- Fixed a bug where the program wasn't able to detect the hdd type
- Fixed a bug where installing the bootloader would fail
- Added the ability to prefix the entries with whatever you want
- Changed interpreter line to "#!/usr/bin/env python3"
- the -E and -G flags to install the extlinux and grub 2 bootloader no longer need parameters.
  -G and -E will both use your /boot entry in /etc/fstab if left blank. If -E has no parameters it
  will install extlinux in /boot/extlinux by default.
- The '-d' and '--drive' flags have been added. This lets you specify what drive you would like to install your bootloader at.
- Better error detection/handling
- Config file has been moved from /etc/bliss-boot/conf.py to /etc/bliss-boot/config.py
- Moved linux distro dependent paths for applications into the libs/Variables.py file. This should help
  people using non-gentoo distributions to easily be able to port the program over.
- The user can now pick what names they want their "kernel" and "initrd" to be called in their config.
  (Not just 'vmlinuz' and 'initrd')
- Indentations have been fixed throughout the whole project (tabs are used)

0.10.4
------------
- Relicensed to the more permissive, Apache License 2.0.
- Changed interpreter from '#/usr/bin/env python' to '#/usr/bin/python3'.
  This is a symlink to the system's python 3.X interpreter. Thus even if the user has python 2.X
  set in 'eselect python list', the program will still work.

0.10.3
--------------------------------------
- Rewrote/restructured boot drive parsing and bootloader installation flow

0.10.2
--------------------------------------
- Temporary added some quick fixes to 'get_bootd_num'. This will be rewritten in the future.

0.10.1
--------------------------------------
- Fixed minor bug with 'die' function not being found in line 104/Toolkit.py

0.10.0
--------------------------------------
- LILO support has been completely removed
- Added parameter support:--output, --force, --install-extlinux, --install-grub2
- Ability to install extlinux and grub2 to drive (including gptmbr for gpt users)

0.9.0
--------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug where the program would crash on creating a symlink on uefi machines's vfat /boot.
- Symlinks are no longer created
- The application now writes a relative path to your kernel/initrd files

0.8.5
--------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug where md devices weren't being generated correctly.

  Note: The application will still generate a file for extlinux,
  or lilo even if it won't work. It is the user's responsability
  to make sure if their bootloader does or doesn't support a specific
  device configuration.

  Example: If you have your /boot in /dev/md0, and you use lilo, and
  it happens that lilo doesn't support booting from /dev/md0, the program
  will still generate a lilo entry, and the boot in lilo.conf will
  equal /dev/md. This is not correct, but intended.

0.8.4
--------------------------------------
- Clearer output messages
- Updated USAGE documentation
- The "lilo.conf" file that was attempted to be generated will also
  be removed if the application fails
- Removed module debug prefixes from output
- GRUB 2 partition modules will be written in config depending style

0.8.3
--------------------------------------
- bliss-boot's configuration file is now in /etc/bliss-boot/conf.py,
  this means that the configuration file is protected by portage.
- extlinux now uses the 'default' kernel as well
- lilo support has been added
- conf.py has a new auto-boot option for extlinux
- some lilo options have been added into the conf.py

0.8.2
--------------------------------------
- Clearer header with email details

0.8.1
--------------------------------------
- Clearer helper message
- Fixed a bug where the header message wasn't always being printed.

0.8.0
--------------------------------------
- Removed reliance on partition layout auto detection (only used for
  appending the correct value to grub 2's name (i.e: (hd0,gpt1))
- Added support for user definable modules (for GRUB 2)
- Added a helper message if a person doesn't have /boot/kernels dir
  (or whatever they set their conf.bootdir to)
- Added header message containing author, license, version, etc

0.7.0
--------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug where the application was still looking at a set (unordered)
  when adding ordered entries into the configuration file. This caused the
  default entry value to be out of sync with the actual entries.
- General code cleanups and enhancements
- Refactoring was done of some stuff
- Colored messages

0.6.2
--------------------------------------
- Fixed typo from last version's check

0.6.1
--------------------------------------
- Program will also delete 'extlinux.conf' is something went wrong

0.6.0
--------------------------------------
- Added ability to disable the use of an 'initrd'
- 'timeout' value will no longer return a decimal place for extlinux
- Ability to append custom bootloader entries to final config
